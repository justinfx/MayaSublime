MayaSublime 3.0.0 change log:

- All console output (ScriptEditor) from Maya can now be captured and streamed to the Sublime Console (shown with `ctrl+~`). To enable this feature, you can do it manually with the 2 new Command Palette commands:

	- "Maya: Enable ScriptEditor Output"
	- "Maya: Disable ScriptEditor Output"

- MayaSublime can automatically enable Maya output collection feature by setting the new MayaSublime user pref: 
	- `"receive_maya_output": true`

- A new user pref can be enabled which tells MayaSublime to wrap all code that is sent to Maya within an undo block:
	- `"create_undo": true`
